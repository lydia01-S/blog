# Now that the second 28 years later movie is coming out soon, here is a review of the movies. 

## The first movie, 28 days later, is one of the best zombie movies around. In my opinion. It is known to be an accurate representation of how a zombie apocolypse would go down, with the military and social implications. But it also has some of the best zombies in media. Along with The last of us, Train to Busan etc. We can see through out the franchise, the zombies are kept to the same standard as the original film. 

## But, the sequeal and the third film within this franchise is very lacking in substance. Mostly due to the fact that they werent wriiten or dirceted by Danny Boyle and Alex Garland. And where seen as more blockbuster movies made just for profits. 

## I was reallllyyy happy to see Alex Garland come back for 28 years later as the writer, as Garland doesnt hold back within his stories. As seen in Ex-Machina and Men. Men being a movie I have a complicated relationship with, as the movie goes so off the rails but had so much potential to be great. 

## 28 years later, is perfect for showing the decent of humans 28 years after the zombies came, along with the evolution of the virus. I was extremely happy in my cinema seat, as a huge fan of this genre to see zombies representated in a very unique and creative way. Have the zombies behave as if they are animalistic and follow an order of command with an alpha zombie who controls the back had me kicking my feet with joy! It is nothing ever seen before, and it is so hard for this genre to have a unique take on zombies, as it is a very worn out topic at this point. Showing the similarites between the humans becoming hunter and gathers to the zombies behaving in a similar manner is genius to me. 

## The only issue with this whole film, and is an issue with Alex Garland, is the ending. Garland loves to throw off the audience at the ending of his stories, as seen in Men, which almost made me leave the cinema all together and left me very mad. He decides to end the amazing zombie movie with a weird cult of perfect condition tracksuits and blonde wigs having a very unrealistic fight scene with a bunch of zombies. At this point, going into an Alex garland movie I have to except that something is going to happen at the end that will just make me question everything.

## I felt this scene did not fit with the entire build up of the movie and left me at the end thinking the movie was just meh, a feeling I see many other people have too. But when I thought back on the movie, I changed my mind. I love the whole story and the unique zombies and thinking of the ending made me create theories of what actually happen. If tthe whole fight seen was even real, or if it was in the childs mind. It is an excellent story. 

## But seeing the trailer for the new movie, it is obvious it was not a dream and there really is a cult of colourful tracksuit wearers fighting zombies. I think i will have to trust that this new movie will be good for my own sake. Hopefully no weird endings.
