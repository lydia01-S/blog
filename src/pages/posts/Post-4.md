# I started to learn bass. I had a bass for a while now but I never had to time to actually learn how to play it cause im always so busy. But Im kinda sick of not having any hobbies anymore and i want to learn something new. I started to try and play some easy bass songs with looking at cords and oh my god its so hard. I dont understand why people keep saying its so easy and how its the best first instrument to learn. Its so hard! My hand cant go around all the strings, i have no co-ordination. I have no musical talent and I hate not knowing how to do things. So learning it is how I expected it to go. Being constantly frustrated.

## Whats even worse is as im practicing, my brother who also has no music history, asked to try and play. And he sounded way better than me. So i banned him from ever touching my bass, obviously. I think its a me issue and that i have no patience and rythmn but i think once i get down one song ill be really happy so ill keep going. And ill probably only be able to play one song and make everyone around me angry they keep hearing the same thing
