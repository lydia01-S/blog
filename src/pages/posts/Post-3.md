## Screenwriting is built upon rules that have been industry standards for years. 90 to 120 pages, no descriptive writing and no giant blunt blocks of dialogue. If you go against this, sending your terrible script to the industry youll be blacklisted! They wont read it, itll just be thrown away.

## There has been hundreds of books, podcasts and videos telling screenwriters the format and not to go against the rules, most famously Save the cat which appears to be the holy grail of screenwriting. You cannot fail if you follow this format. I feel this is a big giant lie.
## In an industry that is ever growing and evolving new ways of doing things, the screenplay, the most important aspect of the film has been given the impression that it is rigid: Short description, little dialogue. A screenplay is telling a story and you cannot hold back your creativity just because you feel as if it wont be percieved well. During my time writing scripts in college, my teacher would always tell me to cut back on my description, and if I want to write like this, I should write novels. Im sad I listened as when I look back on my college scripts, its not the writing I wanted to show. As I read more and more scripts my perception of what is right and what is wrong has completely switched. As screenwriting is evolving, I will stick to my way of writing without fear of the rules.
