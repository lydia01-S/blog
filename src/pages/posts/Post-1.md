# Im working on a little story about a cat named Mr.Bobbles. Even though Im struggling to find time to write about him, I am always thinking about what adventures he is going to go on. Im hoping in the new year, I will have the story fully done!

# This is the story synopis:
## Beware of the cat follows, Mr.Bobbles, a grumpy business-cat who is stuck in a routine, he is suddenly confronted with the passage of time when his office throw him a surprise party honoring his 5 years (36 human years) of service. The realisation shakes him to the core, exhausted by the lack of sleep, he accidently boards the wrong bus home and wakes up stranded in the middle of nowhere. He looks towards the bus timetable to see the next bus isnt until two days. Realising his wife, Ms.Bobbles and ttheir son Little Bobbles will be worried, he decides to walk home. 

## Back in the city, Ms.Bobbles anxiously awaits her husband to come home from work. She decides to put together Missing cat posters. Unkowningly, an eccentric cat bounty hunter spots the posters, and mistakes them for a high stakes dead or alive mission. He hunts for Mr.Bobbles.

## Mr.Bobbles sets off on a surreal journey back to his life in the city. Along the way, he meets wild animals and gets into a capnip deal gone wrong, travels through forests, mountains and caves, befriends a group of cowboys in the desert and comes face to face with the cat bounty hunter. Mr.Bobbles learns to let go and reconnect with his instincts. He slowly transforms into a wild animal. 

## Mr.Bobbles makes it back to the city, and sees his street lined with missing cat posters all resembling him. He reaches his door but is anxious to face Ms.Bobbles, as he is worried she wont like what he became. He opens the door and is met with Ms.Bobbles running to him, hugging him tightly. Little Bobbles, wobbles to him, wearing his business hat. Mr.Bobbles takes it off Little Bobbles and replaces it with his cowboy hat. Mr.Bobbles is happy to be home.
